# ellipsis

[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

Adding `...` to a function specification usually comes with a big
downside: any mispelled or extraneous arguments will be silently
ignored. This package explores an approach to making `...` safer, by
inspecting its contents and warning if any elements were not evaluated.

In the long run, this code is likely to live elsewhere (hopefully R-core
might be interested so we could make it part of base R). This repository
tracks the current state of the experiment.

Thanks to [Jenny Bryan](http://github.com/jennybc) for the idea, and
[Lionel Henry](http://github.com/lionel-) for the heart of the
implementation.

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("hadley/ellipsis")
```

## Example

ellipsis comes with two functions that illustrates how we can make
functionals (which pass `...` to another argument) and S3 generics
(which pass `...` on to their methods) safer. `safe_map()` and
`safe_median()` warn if you supply arguments that are never evaluated.

``` r
library(ellipsis)

x <- safe_map(iris[1:4], median, na.mr = TRUE)
#> Warning: Some components of ... were not used: na.mr
x <- safe_map(iris[1:4], median, na.rm = TRUE)
x <- safe_map(iris[1:4], median, 2)
x <- safe_map(iris[1:4], median, 2, 3)
#> Warning: Some components of ... were not used: ..2

x <- safe_median(1:10)
x <- safe_median(1:10, FALSE)
#> Warning: Some components of ... were not used: ..1
x <- safe_median(1:10, na.rm = FALSE)
x <- safe_median(1:10, na.mr = TRUE)
#> Warning: Some components of ... were not used: na.mr
```

The top-level function handles all evaluation failures so that this only
generates a single warning (not one warning from `safe_map()` and four
from `safe_median()`)

``` r
x <- safe_map(iris[1:4], safe_median, na.mr = TRUE)
#> Warning: Some components of ... were not used: na.mr
```
