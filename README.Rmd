# ellipsis
[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

Adding `...` to a function specification usually comes with a big downside: any mispelled or extraneous arguments will be silently ignored. This package explores an approach to making `...` safer, by inspecting its contents and warning if any elements were not evaluated.

In the long run, this code is likely to live elsewhere (hopefully R-core might be interested so we could make it part of base R). This repository tracks the current state of the experiment.

Thanks to [Jenny Bryan](http://github.com/jennybc) for the idea, and [Lionel Henry](http://github.com/lionel-) for the heart of the implementation.

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("hadley/ellipsis")
```

## Example

ellipsis comes with two functions that illustrates how we can make functionals (which pass `...` to another argument) and S3 generics (which pass `...` on to their methods) safer. `safe_map()` and `safe_median()` warn if you supply arguments that are never evaluated.

```{r example}
library(ellipsis)

x <- safe_map(iris[1:4], median, na.mr = TRUE)
x <- safe_map(iris[1:4], median, na.rm = TRUE)
x <- safe_map(iris[1:4], median, 2)
x <- safe_map(iris[1:4], median, 2, 3)

x <- safe_median(1:10)
x <- safe_median(1:10, FALSE)
x <- safe_median(1:10, na.rm = FALSE)
x <- safe_median(1:10, na.mr = TRUE)
```

The top-level function handles all evaluation failures so that this only generates a single warning (not one warning from `safe_map()` and four from `safe_median()`)

```{r}
x <- safe_map(iris[1:4], safe_median, na.mr = TRUE)
```
